## 📌 Rules and best practices

- Write clear and objective commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.)
- Always explain in the PR **what was changed** and **why**
- Prefer smaller, iterative changes
- For large suggestions or route changes, **open an issue first**
- Any code should be functional and follow existing patterns

Before submitting a PR, make sure that:

- The project still runs locally (see `BUILD.md`)
- Your contribution doesn't break existing endpoints or app flow
- Documentation has been updated (if necessary)
- Code follows the design system and component patterns
- TypeScript types are properly defined

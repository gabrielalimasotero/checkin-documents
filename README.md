# 📍 CheckIn – Social Venue Check-in Platform

**CheckIn** is a modern mobile-first social platform that connects people through shared venue experiences. The app allows users to check into restaurants, bars, and venues while discovering new places and connecting with friends.

Developed as a React-based mobile application, CheckIn answers the practical questions:
- _"Where should I go out today?"_
- _"Who should I go with?"_

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Reduce decision time for going out
- Help users find active, safe places with good vibes
- Enable more natural social encounters connected to the moment
- Support venues in organizing flow, reservations, and promotion
- Provide a smooth, light, and personalized experience
